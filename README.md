#Test Case: Weather report system

Requirements:
•	language: PHP
•	Framework: Laravel 8.+
•	Allowed Database: MySQL
Use Case
Create simple page that displays user name, last name and the weather of the user’s current location.
•	There must be a registration page, where the user can setup his/her credentials
•	Weather information should be pulled through API to any free weather application available (example: https://openweathermap.org/)
•	There needs to be a separate page only available to admins that can view information of any user that has used their application, like their name and their location (e.g. Shunattan Davelaar - Curacao Willemstad)    
//The location name should be pulled based on the user geolocation, in other words the user doesn't need to enter their location but the browser will pop up with a request to allow share location and when the user clicks ok we can get that info.

Test Goals:
•	How applicant handles API
•	Permission management
•	Encrypting user sensitive information such as password
•	Create DB table
