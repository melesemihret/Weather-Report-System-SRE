Test Case: Weather report system

Requirements:

    •	language: PHP

    •	Framework: Laravel 8.+

    •	Allowed Database: MySQL

Use Case

Create simple page that displays user name, last name and the weather of the user’s current location.

    •	There must be a registration page, where the user can setup his/her credentials

    •	Weather information should be pulled through API to any free weather application available (example: https://openweathermap.org/)

    •	There needs to be a separate page only available to admins that can view information of any user that has used their application, like their name and their location (e.g. Shunattan Davelaar - Curacao Willemstad)    

    //The location name should be pulled based on the user geolocation, in other words the user doesn't need to enter their location but the browser will pop up with a request to allow share location and when the user clicks ok we can get that info.


Test Goals:

    •	How applicant handles API

    •	Permission management

    •	Encrypting user sensitive information such as password

    •	Create DB table
